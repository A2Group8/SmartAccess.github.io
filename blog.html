              <h2 class="mb-4">Project Description</h2>
            <p style="font-size:125%;">Carrying lots of items with you everywhere you go can sometimes be troublesome especially losing them. In the United States alone, 20 million car/house keys are lost per year. <font size="1.5">(2008.Retrieved from http://www.smartitag.com/Facts_Lostandfound.htm)</font>
In Australia, 1,800 Bank cards are lost per day <font size="1.5">(Jolly, 2018)</font> and at least 34% of Australian lost their purse/wallet and a further 24% have lost their house keys each year. Thus, necessary ideas are needed to solve this problem. In this project idea we envision a Smartphone app that can replace all your keys and cards and become 'The key’, One key for everything, be it the car, the house, use it for payments instead of a bank card or cash, or even when using public transport, tap the phone and you are good to go, access university printing, sure just tap the phone, just as easy as that without needing to physically have it or operate it. Since everyone nowadays have everything already stored on a smartphone application, there’s not much things to worry about losing besides the smartphone. The application comes with multiple function such as locking/unlocking home doors, garage, locking/unlocking the car, parental control and operating about every connected machine without the necessity of physical contact.
</p>
<p style="font-size:125%;">
As smartphones and connected technology have become an integrated part of everyday life and modern society in Australia and the whole world, it goes without saying that the demand for smartphones application developers is at an extreme high. Due to this, smartphone application development is among the top popular career choice and its highly paid due to the heavy workload in moving data to and from the cloud. The application stores digital locking codes which allows users to freely lock/unlock item with just a tap of the smartphone. This application not only allow users to lock/unlock it but also have parental control which allows/denies access to certain items from, be it children or any other party. Not only that, the application also provides an automated functioning capability which allow users to use items without the necessity of physical contact with the device. This application also comes with a history feature that allows users to brief through who uses the item, recording the date, time and unique identity of the device along with the user profile. This will also drastically help the users by reducing the items they carry everyday which means all they need is the smartphone. Easy access, easy life.
</p>
<p style="font-size:125%;">
This project idea has the potential to allow users to gain easier access home features in a way that recommend using the application with Fingerprint ID, Face/iris recognition, using a pin or a password. The application includes display features like unlock/lock function, timer, access history, manage users and give access to users be it temporary or permanent. It can unlock/lock home, garage doors or cars without the use of keys, remotes or switches with just a single tap through our smartphones. It allows users to operate home appliances like coffee machines, control light switches, tv’s, heater/aircon, kitchen appliances such as controlling the heat of your stove, oven and microwave on a set date or following a regular schedule. It also comes with history information to show who uses the item with date and time. This application also comes with a distance feature. For example, if the user walks away within the range, the home item will stop functioning immediately and will lock the entire house and will send a warning notification to the user’s smartphone. Other than that, it also comes with child safety, only allowing certain home item for children to access. This can be done by selecting certain household items/appliances through the app using your smartphone and setting it to “child lock”.
</p>
  <p style="font-size:125%;">
Even though the App will be providing users with convenience, development is a real challenge, not as easy as it sounds, will be a really complex system. The App will be recording a key or a card, store it and will beam the exact same key / card when requested for, and for security / verification, a PIN or biometric input will be required for a transaction to be approved, for approved access or for membership verification. For the system to work properly, collaboration with other developers is essential and would need to get authorization from the relevant organizations and authorities like, Department of Public Transport, VISA Inc., MasterCard, and other affiliated banks and organizations.
</p>
<p style="font-size:125%;">
To create a successful app, apart from the Android Development Tools of choice, (which would be Android Studio, Eclipse or Visual studio w/ Xamarin) iOS development Tools of choice (XCode, Firebase, Visual Studio w/ Xamarin) and a Smartphone with NFC capabilities required to run the application, Application Security Frameworks like IPC and Technologies like ASLR and NX must be used to ensure security. For the second approach, special hardware development tools will be required.
</p>
<p style="font-size:125%;">
The developers will need multiple skills. One of it is a must-have analytical skill. It’s the ability to analyse on the behaviour of the smartphone user on their devices which is an essential skill to have. The developer must be creative on how the users incorporate their smartphone into their lives and then create application that help the user with easy usage. Next is the most common skill which is problem solving. It’s the biggest part when developing an application. The task is to troubleshoot issues with application on either android or IOS. The developers will need to recognize various technical problems and understand how to resolve them within given time. And finally, the knowledge of programming language that is necessary for a smartphone developer. For apple developers generally use swift and Android commonly uses JAVA. Other modern programming languages that can be used include HTML and Objective-C. For a stable program to be developed, a high skill level on Java and Swift will be needed for the Android and iOS platforms, the mainstream mobile OSes and an NFC API should be incorporated with the development of the app. Incorporation of Security a based skills and encryption skills with the development of App in order to keep away from vulnerabilities and overall security is prominent. In order to add smart home capabilities to the app, the use of a smart home API and with experience in the field of IoT and skills in Hardware Interfacing, IP Networking and Automation are required. If the second approach is followed, further skills in Hardware and electronics development and physical security specialty skills are required.
</p>
  <p style="font-size:125%;">
If the project is successful, with the success of the project, comes ‘Ease of Access’, humans would only need ‘one key’ for their daily lives, which would be their smartphone in order to access their belongings and other services. People would have a lot less things to worry about losing and no more need to pay for replacement of lost keys and cards. It only makes your life easier and more convenient. people will have a better lifestyle where they can access the house hold items easily. Hence, people will have better time efficiency and less effort on preparing. However, smartphones are a daily necessity, this means that people carry the device with them everywhere, all the time. Smartphones can pose multiple security risk such as stolen and hacked. Therefore, the app gets weekly updates and constant reviewing of the app, including security checks to lower the risks of vulnerabilities. When it’s approved, people will just basically need their smartphones to gain access to anything and everything without the need to bring multiple items wherever they go making your life easier and more convenient.
<p>

    <h2 class="mb-4">Aims</h2>
<p style="font-size:125%;">
  Technology is rapidly evolving and with the tech today, anything and everything is achievable. The main Aim of doing this project is to equip every day-to-day item that needs authorization, like keys, bank cards, public transport cards, etc. into one smartphone application with the ability to access to all your belongings, items and services compatible, without having it physically, but recorded on the phone and no matter where the person is. In order to achieve the main goal, several smaller goals need to achieve in order to be fulfilled. Those goals will be getting the App on all mobile platforms, getting hardware and manufacturer support, getting Smart Home and IoT support and adding security features
</p>

<p style="font-size:125%;">
  Getting the smartphone application available for all the major mobile platforms is important because by making the app available on all platforms it will reach a larger audience and cause a positive impact on the users and will also help in gaining the attention of hardware manufacturers and authorities which are Android and iOS at the moment.
</p>

<p style="font-size:125%;">
  As we do not have the capability in manufacturing all the compatible device by ourselves, we will be needing support to incorporate existing hardware with our application and will be needing hardware manufacturer’s support for developing more hardware, this step is also very important as it is what gives the app functionality.
</p>

<p style="font-size:125%;">
  We Will also need to incorporate Smart Home and IoT support to get the remote access features to work, although it's not very important or is a main goal, it is added functionality, after all the more the app does, the wider the success.
</p>

<p style="font-size:125%;">
  The application must have extreme, high-security protection and encryption to protect the people from any unauthorized activities and from exploiting any insecurities within the application by having security features built-in to the app. With This Project there can be no compromises, even though the main goal of the project is to provide access to anything that requires authorization, it cannot be done without proper security, hence this is a risk doing this project as there can be no cutbacks with this project. It’s all or nothing.
</p>

      <h2 class="mb-4">Plans And Progress</h2>

      <p style="font-size:125%;">
        Our team decided to make a mobile application which combines as many things as we see fit in order to simplify life, many of us could relate to being frustrated at losing items especially keys when they mattered the most thus the team put a lot of effort into thinking about a solution, that is where project smart access comes in, the thing that combines it all.. We looked further into such an app and decided to make it a mobile app because literally everyone owns some kind of smartphone in 2018 thus a mobile app would be suitable for profit and the overall success of the project as the release of such a mobile app would already have a great platform for release.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size:125%;">
          Our aim is to combine everyday items and tasks mentioned above (keys and bank cards etc), with this being said our main plan is to create an interface and then the app and then further down the line we would add other features that our team comes up with, for now we have decided that we should have at least bank cards, keys and public transport as our main features combined with in the app. As of now we’re in interface prototype design stage, this stage is rather simple. We would like to have an aesthetic but minimalistic design for our interface. Once we have that set goal completed, we would run user tests to tweak out poor design choices or even to put on new features requested and then we would move to coding stages and actual releasing of the app.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size:125%;">
          So far, we have started to experiment with what works within the design and what kind of layout we would like to use but as of now it has not been clearly decided, the team only have a brief idea of what the layout should be.</p>
        </p>


                                        <ol style= "font-size: 125%">The discussed details for the layout are:</li>
                                        <li>Clean simple start up screen.</li>
                                        <li>Will have tabs or sections to separate each function.</li>
                                        <li>Start up of app will require user verification.</li>
                                        <li> Further verification when trying to use more sensitive material (determined by user with the exception of Bank section which will definitely be enforced to have verification)</li>
                                      </ol>
<br>
                                      <p style="font-size:125%;">We have yet to dwell into deep coding ideas and decided we will most likely hire another member to the team who has the capability of coding for IOS and android apps.</p>

            <p style="font-size:125%;">
              Apart from the planning and discussion of how to go about our project we did however run into some issues pointed out by fellow peers and also whilst discussing. First and biggest issue should have been obvious from creating the idea, but such an app would raise security alarms. However, through research we found there are many ways to provide security for sensitive data such as encryption of pin codes within our system or even storing such data on internal storage meaning it would be stored on user’s phone which will already have its own encryption from apples OS but also protected via users pin code.
              </p>

              <p style="font-size:125%;">
                The second set of risks include the usage of our app to be used as keys to open your house or car. To combat this, the team decided to use similar techniques of protecting personal data from also encryption. Encryption nowadays can be done on routers which transmitted data via Wi-Fi signals, so this kind of technology can be implemented on data transmitted from the phone. This would mean signals which unlock your house can not be easily hacked and thus can ensure security of our mobile app. Of course, such security measures could only be done by security specialists which would be hired to rule out security risks arising from our mobile app. Other issues include business side issues such as getting the approval of Banks and Metro to allow their features to be stored and used on our app.
                </p>

        <h2 class="mb-4">Roles</h2>
        <p style="font-size:125%;">
        In this project we have not assign any roles. This is because everyone in the team are working together to complete section by section. As result the project was able to be run smoothly. Firstly, everyone must come out with a design regarding the smart access app. The user interface was roughly sketch and it was further improved on the later days. After that we move on to the technical design which we did the similar process of sketching it first and further improve. Programming is the part where we face trouble as we must spend most of the time to code the program. At the end we manage to finish the coding and get the app to run.
        </p>

          <h2 class="mb-4">Scope and Limits</h2>
          <p style="font-size:125%;">
            In this project we will be able to reduces the possibility of losing keys and cards where statistically, in Australia, 1,800 Bank cards are lost per day and in the United States alone, 20 million car/house keys are lost per year. Apart from that, we will be able to provide a better daily lifestyle. If many people lost their keys or cards very often, it can cause a major problem in long term. For instance, the more keys and cards will be produced which can cause pollution by the factories. Apart from that, losing keys or cards can be scary as people who found those items might try to use it. For example, using the bank card to illegally buy items without the owner’s authority. Another possibility is that the keys might be used to open the owner’s house and robbery might occur. We will be able to develop an of this scope to a certain extent.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:125%;">
              Development of hardware is a limit we meet, it won't be an easy task for us to develop hardware in a consumer level. Furthermore, there are some parts of this application that will be hard to improve to the maximum level. For instance, the security of the application. Since this app is still new, there are a lot of things to improve and it is difficult to find the problem unless it is being used officially. Besides, the interface of the app could have been better and refined if the team have more time to improve it.
              </p>
            <h2 class="mb-4">Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p style="font-size:125%;">
            For the development of the Android App, we will be using Android Studio v3.2.1 and will be using Java as the language for coding the Android App as this ‘was’ the official language for android development, until late 2017 when they introduced Kotlin as the official android language, which isn’t well established yet as opposed to Java that is easy to handle, and many open source libraries are made available for users to choose from.For the development of the iOS application Swift is a great native language and will be using Xcode 10 which includes all the tools necessary for all Apple platforms. A Standard High Performance Laptop running Windows and another MacBook is expected to be used (as Xcode run only on MacOS). The Windows Laptop should be with at least 8GB of RAM as Android Studio is heavily taxing on the RAM.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:125%;">
              Senaru has had previous experience with Android Studio in designing part of the ui, even though it’s not much it can be of use for this project.
              </p>
              <h2 class="mb-4">Testing</h2>
              <p style="font-size:125%;">
              Before testing, the team mainly Senaru and Tommy will design a prototype from skills
developed from User Centered Design course from RMIT. The prototype will consist of a
mobile app prototype which is made via screen editors which can make a simulation of a
mobile app on computer, such tools include Proto.io (actual URL). Using proto.io will allow
us to create a prototype which we can then design a user test for designated user groups
created by the prototype team (Tommy+Senaru). User test created will consist of mainly
one on one interviews testing and comparing different types of UI designs to gain feedback
on what worked well within the interface such as good use of font or layout and overall
usability. Once the best interface is chosen, 2 nd stage will commence. 2 nd stage will be
application of coding, once the coding for the mobile app is completed, testing of the code
will be done by the usage of “Xcode” apples graphical interface for making ios apps. Newer
and more improved versions will be created via app testing on Xcode. Once the base of the
app is made, it will be ready to be released in beta stages. This stage will be used for user
tests to pick out bugs etc to eventually release the full version of the app (Does not mean
updates can not be made).
</p>

                <h2 class="mb-4">Timeframe</h2>

                <img src="images/tf.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">

                  <h2 class="mb-4">Risks</h2>

                  <p style="font-size:125%;">
                    There are potentially 2 types of risks, one of them rendering the project unsuccessful, and the others could be security risks;
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size:125%;">
                      The project could become unsuccessful in many ways. For the project to be successful, we need existing smart devices, access to them, support from the manufacturers and developers too. So if that goes badly, the project goes kaput.
And we will also be needing access and support from relevant authorities, like MasterCard, VISA Card, support from other banks and also be approved by the governments and public transportation.

                      </p>

                      <p style="font-size:125%;">
                        Security Risks may include security holes undetected and not patched which could be exploited by hackers being able to access, manipulate and steal users personal information and this can also be a problem getting approved by authorities and companies such as visa, Mastercard and other banks. In order to prevent this from happening to our system and app, weekly updates must be administered, the use of good encryption and security protocols to ensure all users data is protected. The users can also protect their personal data by using a two factor authentication process and fingerprint recognition.
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-size:125%;">
                          Not having enough supported devices may also be a risk. To make our app compatible to all devices, weekly updates my be set on the app to keep up with new device, IoT and Smart Home support.
                          </p>

                          <p style="font-size:125%;">
                            Also, not having the right software developers may slow down the process of making the app as they may have little experience which may result in a very poorly finished app and may also not have the right softwares installed. To prevent this from happening, we must hire professional app developers who understand what we want in our app and can quickly adapt to any changes we may have along the way.

                            </p>



                    <h2 class="mb-4">Group processes and communications</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:125%;">
                    We are a group of six members and communicating with each other was such a haggle, although we did begin off with a very rough start, with everyone all over the place, we ended up narrowing down and allocating our tasks effectively across the members in the group, a thing that we could have improved for the second assignment, which went down due to bad communication. Later on, in the need to be able to communicate properly as some of us did not use the same social media, our only form of communication became WhatsApp which everyone was insisted in installing. But even then, the responses were rather delayed hence the inability to communicate effectively. What surprised me was the different sets of interests and what we each wanted to do in the future was completely different to one another, hence each person had a job that was distinctive to the person, and that made it an interesting fact to learn about each other. Initial we discussed about work and divided it into six part so that everyone can do their part with their knowledge as well as skills related to our assignment. Moreover, we discussed about work and helping each other to complete the assignment. We sometimes arranged meetings at the RMIT library so that we easily complete our work and get experience working with a team which will definitely help to get team work skills and experience to interact with peoples. There is no member in our group who haven’t responded to messages even though being late. But in an unfortunate incident if any of the members are not cooperative / cooperative enough and/or not communicating, we would try to fix this through a meeting with all members on the tutorial or lecture day and discuss with him the importance and participation of the work and confirm from that members if he will need us or not with his work and after we will take a decision related to the response and start focusing on our parts. Overall, our group is good and every member is cooperative enough to do work and connect with everyone with respect and good support.
