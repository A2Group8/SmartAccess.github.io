              <h2 class="mb-4">Project Description</h2>
            <p style="font-size:125%;">Carrying lots of items with you everywhere you go can sometimes be troublesome especially losing them. In the United States alone, 20 million car/house keys are lost per year. <font size="1.5">(2008.Retrieved from http://www.smartitag.com/Facts_Lostandfound.htm)</font>
In Australia, 1,800 Bank cards are lost per day <font size="1.5">(Jolly, 2018)</font> and at least 34% of Australian lost their purse/wallet and a further 24% have lost their house keys each year. Thus, necessary ideas are needed to solve this problem. In this project idea we envision a Smartphone app that can replace all your keys and cards and become 'The key’, One key for everything, be it the car, the house, use it for payments instead of a bank card or cash, or even when using public transport, tap the phone and you are good to go, access university printing, sure just tap the phone, just as easy as that without needing to physically have it or operate it. Since everyone nowadays have everything already stored on a smartphone application, there’s not much things to worry about losing besides the smartphone. The application comes with multiple function such as locking/unlocking home doors, garage, locking/unlocking the car, parental control and operating about every connected machine without the necessity of physical contact.
</p>
<p style="font-size:125%;">
As smartphones and connected technology have become an integrated part of everyday life and modern society in Australia and the whole world, it goes without saying that the demand for smartphones application developers is at an extreme high. Due to this, smartphone application development is among the top popular career choice and its highly paid due to the heavy workload in moving data to and from the cloud. The application stores digital locking codes which allows users to freely lock/unlock item with just a tap of the smartphone. This application not only allow users to lock/unlock it but also have parental control which allows/denies access to certain items from, be it children or any other party. Not only that, the application also provides an automated functioning capability which allow users to use items without the necessity of physical contact with the device. This application also comes with a history feature that allows users to brief through who uses the item, recording the date, time and unique identity of the device along with the user profile. This will also drastically help the users by reducing the items they carry everyday which means all they need is the smartphone. Easy access, easy life.
</p>
<p style="font-size:125%;">
This project idea has the potential to allow users to gain easier access home features in a way that recommend using the application with Fingerprint ID, Face/iris recognition, using a pin or a password. The application includes display features like unlock/lock function, timer, access history, manage users and give access to users be it temporary or permanent. It can unlock/lock home, garage doors or cars without the use of keys, remotes or switches with just a single tap through our smartphones. It allows users to operate home appliances like coffee machines, control light switches, tv’s, heater/aircon, kitchen appliances such as controlling the heat of your stove, oven and microwave on a set date or following a regular schedule. It also comes with history information to show who uses the item with date and time. This application also comes with a distance feature. For example, if the user walks away within the range, the home item will stop functioning immediately and will lock the entire house and will send a warning notification to the user’s smartphone. Other than that, it also comes with child safety, only allowing certain home item for children to access. This can be done by selecting certain household items/appliances through the app using your smartphone and setting it to “child lock”.
</p>
  <p style="font-size:125%;">
Even though the App will be providing users with convenience, development is a real challenge, not as easy as it sounds, will be a really complex system. The App will be recording a key or a card, store it and will beam the exact same key / card when requested for, and for security / verification, a PIN or biometric input will be required for a transaction to be approved, for approved access or for membership verification. For the system to work properly, collaboration with other developers is essential and would need to get authorization from the relevant organizations and authorities like, Department of Public Transport, VISA Inc., MasterCard, and other affiliated banks and organizations.
</p>
<p style="font-size:125%;">
To create a successful app, apart from the Android Development Tools of choice, (which would be Android Studio, Eclipse or Visual studio w/ Xamarin) iOS development Tools of choice (XCode, Firebase, Visual Studio w/ Xamarin) and a Smartphone with NFC capabilities required to run the application, Application Security Frameworks like IPC and Technologies like ASLR and NX must be used to ensure security. For the second approach, special hardware development tools will be required.
</p>
<p style="font-size:125%;">
The developers will need multiple skills. One of it is a must-have analytical skill. It’s the ability to analyse on the behaviour of the smartphone user on their devices which is an essential skill to have. The developer must be creative on how the users incorporate their smartphone into their lives and then create application that help the user with easy usage. Next is the most common skill which is problem solving. It’s the biggest part when developing an application. The task is to troubleshoot issues with application on either android or IOS. The developers will need to recognize various technical problems and understand how to resolve them within given time. And finally, the knowledge of programming language that is necessary for a smartphone developer. For apple developers generally use swift and Android commonly uses JAVA. Other modern programming languages that can be used include HTML and Objective-C. For a stable program to be developed, a high skill level on Java and Swift will be needed for the Android and iOS platforms, the mainstream mobile OSes and an NFC API should be incorporated with the development of the app. Incorporation of Security a based skills and encryption skills with the development of App in order to keep away from vulnerabilities and overall security is prominent. In order to add smart home capabilities to the app, the use of a smart home API and with experience in the field of IoT and skills in Hardware Interfacing, IP Networking and Automation are required. If the second approach is followed, further skills in Hardware and electronics development and physical security specialty skills are required.
</p>
  <p style="font-size:125%;">
If the project is successful, with the success of the project, comes ‘Ease of Access’, humans would only need ‘one key’ for their daily lives, which would be their smartphone in order to access their belongings and other services. People would have a lot less things to worry about losing and no more need to pay for replacement of lost keys and cards. It only makes your life easier and more convenient. people will have a better lifestyle where they can access the house hold items easily. Hence, people will have better time efficiency and less effort on preparing. However, smartphones are a daily necessity, this means that people carry the device with them everywhere, all the time. Smartphones can pose multiple security risk such as stolen and hacked. Therefore, the app gets weekly updates and constant reviewing of the app, including security checks to lower the risks of vulnerabilities. When it’s approved, people will just basically need their smartphones to gain access to anything and everything without the need to bring multiple items wherever they go making your life easier and more convenient.
<p>

    <h2 class="mb-4">Aims</h2>
<p style="font-size:125%;">
    Technology is rapidly evolving and with the tech today, anything and everything is achievable. The main purpose of doing the project is to equip every day-to-day item that needs authorization into one smartphone application with the ability to access to anything and everything no matter where the person is. In order to achieve the main goal, several smaller goals need to achieve in order to be fulfilled. The Main goal is to get the smartphone application available for all the major mobile platforms, which are Android and iOS at the moment. The application must have extreme, high-security protection and encryption to protect the people from any unauthorized activities and from exploiting any insecurities within the application by having security features built-in to the app.

With This Project there can be no compromises, even though the main goal of the project is to provide access to anything that requires authorization, it cannot be done without proper security, hence this is a risk doing this project as there can be no cutbacks with this project. It’s all or nothing.
