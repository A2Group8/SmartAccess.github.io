            <h2 class="mb-3">Intro: (What does it do?)</h2>
            <p>What is a “robot”? A robot is a machine that has the ability to perform complex tasks, but this definition has been warped into what most people think a robot to be is a physical autonomous humanoid like machinery, in reality robots can include your smart phone, your computer or even your printer, typically robots are machinery that can be programmed.
The history behind robots is actually rather long, where one of the very first ideas of having robots came from the famous philosopher Aristotle , he had quoted “If every tool, when ordered, or even of its own accord, could do the work that befits it... then there would be no need either of apprentices for the master workers or of slaves for the lords.” – Aristotle (320 BC). The first signs of robotics came from Joseph Henry in 1835 who invented a relay which is a remote switch controlled by electrical currents passed through it. This technology was then used to aid the invention of the telephone. Further down the line, similar technology was used to develop robotics via the use of circuit technology.
Robots in current time have come along way where they can be used to replace human efforts to perform tasks more precisely and efficiently such as autonomous robots are being industrialised and used manufacture cars instead of humans making it, these autonomous robots have cut down the production time of cars where in the past it had taken people a couple of days with little aid from robots to make one car in a couple of days where as in current times, it takes as little as 17-18 hours as stated by Toyota. This time may vary however between different car companies, this is clear evidence of the rapid robot advancements made over just a few decades. Apart from making cars robotics are used for doing jobs that are too dangerous for humans or for doing jobs faster than humans
This includes:
1)	Military services – Robotics are used for military services where lots of task involve some sense of danger for humans to perform, this includes dealing with explosive devices where a Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) robot is used to examine as well as deactivate explosive devices.
2)	Exploration – Space exploration has sparked a lot of interest into todays community, this had led to development of robots to travel far distances in space and explore/observe areas in space which are unsafe for humans to explore. A prime example of this is the infamous Mars Rover which is a remotely operated vehicle (a robot). Under sea exploration also have the use of remotely operated vehicles to explore depths of the ocean which has immense pressure which can crush most objects would be challenging for humans to explore.
3)	Agriculture – The harvesting of crops had traditionally been by hand but thanks to machinery, harvesting of crops have become much more efficient.
These are only 3 examples of the current usage of robotics, there are many more great uses of machinery and robots.

            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">What can robotics do in the future?  </h2>
            <p>As of now, most robotics are already at its peak but require some sort of human interaction to operate with very few exceptions. Many engineers and theorist believe that robotics in the future will eventually be smart enough to run itself. This would be possible if Artificial intelligence were to be developed smart enough to operate itself at a complex level. Currently, modern robots do not have the capacity to be artificial intelligent but instead just follow steps programmed into its system. Artificial intelligent development would take this to a whole other level as simple robots who just fellow codes and programs can than choose its on action and operations. This idea is already being implemented with A.I computers just at lower levels of complexity where A.I can learn from its experience, it’s been shown that current A.I can learn how to walk and even play games better than humans can.
            <p>
              <img src="images/image_8.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">What is the likely impact?</h2>
            <p>Development of robots who have artificial intelligence (A.I) may provide a solution to some of the global world issues that we currently face such as Safety or security of people where robots can be used to protect people very much like police, this would also remove the dangers of having to risk human lives (policemen). Robots can also provide a solution to poverty, as they can be utilised to run farms and harvest crops faster than humans can.
Although robots with Artificial intelligence can open roads to many great things, it has proven to be quiet the ethical problem with many people showing concern for development of such an entity. Many claim robots with A.I can steal a lot of jobs thus causing more unemployment. There is a greater fear though it may be farfetched, but many people claim that A.I will take over the world in the future, they believe that A.I can someday value its existence over humans and try to take over. This concept has been shown in many different moves and games such as Terminator where A.I developed so much that it had the capacity to override all our technology and its systems and proceed with genocide. If robots with more advance A.I come to exist, it wouldn’t affect a handful of people but effect everyone in the world. So apart from solving global issues, robots with A.I may also give rise to more global issues.


            <p>
              <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">How will this affect you?</h2>
              <p>Robots with A.I can help to minimise daily tasks and jobs to do, instead of having to wake up, brush your teeth choose what you’re going to wear and make breakfast, A.I robots can be used as your own personal maid to do these things for you. Robotic A.I can be implemented into practically everything we do in our daily lives such as shop for food, everything will be automated, no more cashiers or even more drastic, there would be no need to go shopping as your robot can just go down to the store to buy things on your behalf. This idea of using robots to do everything for us has the potential to replace many jobs, this will affect many people and can drive people to poverty. With all that being said, this is just a small glimpse of how Robotic A.I can affect us in the future and no one can really tell how A.I will actually affect our lives.
